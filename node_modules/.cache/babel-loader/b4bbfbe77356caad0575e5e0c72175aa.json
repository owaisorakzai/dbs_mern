IMPORTANT: Our Service Purpose of our service 8.1 The purpose of our service is to simplify the process of arranging for DBS checks, to minimise the risk of rejection due to mistakes and provide you with reasonable support.  Our fast track service aims to [insert]. We are an independent intermediary, not connected with an official government authority. If you apply directly to the official body, you will only have to pay the official fee and not our service fee but then you will not receive any of the benefits provided by our service. What we will do 8.2 Provided that you have supplied us with all of the correct and necessary information including ID documents, we will check it and take reasonable steps to submit your DBS application within two business days. 8.3 Once the DBS certificate has been issued, we will alert you by email and, when we receive the original, we will post it within two business days to the address you have provided. If we don\\u2019t receive the original within a reasonable time, we will chase it for you. 8.4 We do not promise that your application will be successful or, if it is, that either the official body will respond or you will receive your certificate within any particular timeframe. For example, it may get lost in the post. 8.5 We promise to supply our service with reasonable care and skill. Your responsibilities 8.6 It is your responsibility to take reasonable steps to ensure that all information which you supply to us is accurate and complete. You agree to respond to any request by us for further information promptly and in any case within 30 days (or any alternative period we give you). NB We are entitled to end our contract with you by email notice if you fail to provide the information within that time. If so, you have no right to a refund unless you have \\u201Ccooling off\\u201D rights as explained above. 8.7 It is also your responsibility to tell us if you do not receive your original certificate within seven business days (or any alternative timescale we suggest) from when we tell you that the certificate has been posted to you. 8.8 You must also take any additional steps reasonably needed as part of your application. 8.9 You promise that you are eligible for or entitled to the DBS certificate for which you apply. (For example, you may not be eligible for or entitled to a certificate if you live permanently outside the UK.) It is your responsibility to check before you apply. There is no refund if your application is rejected on grounds of lack of eligibility or entitlement unless (a) you have \\u201Ccooling off\\u201D rights as explained above or (b) we decide in our discretion to make a refund. 9. Acceptable use of our Service 9.1 You agree that you will not in connection with the Service: a) breach any applicable law, regulation or code of conduct; b) provide us with any information that includes someone else\\u2019s personal information unless that person is 16 years or over and you have obtained that person\\u2019s explicit written consent or you are the parent/guardian of such person; c) use the Service to provide a similar service to third parties or otherwise with a view to competing with us; d) use the Service for junk mail, spam, pyramid or similar or fraudulent schemes; e) do anything which may have the effect of disrupting the Service including  worms, viruses, software bombs or mass mailings; f) do anything which may negatively affect other Users\\u2019 enjoyment of the Service; g) gain unauthorised access to any part of the Service or equipment used to provide the Service; h) intercept or modify communications to or from the Service; i) circumvent any security or other features of the Service including features that restrict use or copying of content; or j) attempt, encourage or assist any of the above. 10.

 <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n        1.1 We are Administration Gateway Ltd trading as “DBS Gateway”. Our company information is at the end of this document. \n\n    2. Definitions\n        2.1 Capitalised terms have the following meanings in these terms and conditions: \n            a) “Consumer” - an individual acting for purposes which are wholly or mainly outside that person’s trade, business, craft or profession.\n            b) “Service” – our website, the services we offer by means of our website or by phone and any related software and services. \n            c) “User” - persons or organisations using our Service (whether or not registered with us).\n\n    3. What this is all about – introduction to our terms and conditions\n        3.1 These are our terms and conditions which apply to our Service. We’ve tried to make them user-friendly. Please read them carefully and save a copy as we don’t file a copy specifically for the transaction with you. They’re available in English only.\n\n    4. Changes to the terms and conditions\n        4.1 We may change these terms and conditions by posting the new version on our website. Please check our website from time to time. The new version will apply if you make a new order following the effective date shown. \n\n    5. Who can use our Service?\n        5.1 You must not use, or attempt to use, our Service unless you are over 16 years of age.\n\n    6. Forming a contract with us \n        6.1 Your order is an offer to enter a legal contract with us. \n\n        6.2 Website: You place your order by using the ordering process on our site. This involves transmitting the order to us by clicking on the “Pay Now” or equivalent button. This process permits you to check and amend any errors before making an order by using the change function and/or the internet browser back button. \n\n        6.3 Phone: When you contact us, we will collect your details and email you an invoice for payment. You place your order by clicking on the payment link in that email. \n\n        6.4 We will send you a confirmation email after your order. This is our acceptance of your offer and the point at which a legally binding contract is formed. \n\n    7. Right to cancel (“cooling off”)\n        7.1 If you are a Consumer located in the European Economic Area, you have the right to cancel this contract subject to the provisions set out below.  \n\n        7.2 You lose the right to cancel contracts for the supply of services which have been fully performed, i.e. completed. (Completion of our services is explained below.)\n\n        7.3 If you do have the right to cancel, the following apply:\n\nRight to cancel\n        7.4 You have the right to cancel this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.\n\n        7.5 The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract. \n\n        7.6 To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us, Administration Gateway Ltd, of Suite 305 Daisyfield Business Centre, Appleby Street, Blackburn, Lancashire, BB1 3BL, email address below, telephone number +44 (0) 333 011 3500, of your decision to cancel this contract by a clear statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail). You may use the model cancellation form at the end of this document but it is not obligatory.\n \n        7.7 To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has expired.\n\nEffects of cancellation\n        7.8 If you cancel this contract, we will reimburse to you all payments received from you.\n\n        7.9 We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel this contract.\n\n        7.10 We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement. \n\n        7.11 If you requested us to begin the performance of services during the cancellation period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been performed until you have communicated to us your cancellation of this contract in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.\n\n    8. IMPORTANT: Our Service\nPurpose of our service\n        8.1 The purpose of our service is to simplify the process of arranging for DBS checks, to minimise the risk of rejection due to mistakes and provide you with reasonable support.  Our fast track service aims to [insert]. We are an independent intermediary, not connected with an official government authority. If you apply directly to the official body, you will only have to pay the official fee and not our service fee but then you will not receive any of the benefits provided by our service.\n\nWhat we will do\n        8.2 Provided that you have supplied us with all of the correct and necessary information including ID documents, we will check it and take reasonable steps to submit your DBS application within two business days. \n\n        8.3 Once the DBS certificate has been issued, we will alert you by email and, when we receive the original, we will post it within two business days to the address you have provided. If we don’t receive the original within a reasonable time, we will chase it for you. \n\n        8.4 We do not promise that your application will be successful or, if it is, that either the official body will respond or you will receive your certificate within any particular timeframe. For example, it may get lost in the post.\n\n        8.5 We promise to supply our service with reasonable care and skill. \n\nYour responsibilities\n        8.6 It is your responsibility to take reasonable steps to ensure that all information which you supply to us is accurate and complete. You agree to respond to any request by us for further information promptly and in any case within 30 days (or any alternative period we give you). NB We are entitled to end our contract with you by email notice if you fail to provide the information within that time. If so, you have no right to a refund unless you have “cooling off” rights as explained above.\n\n        8.7 It is also your responsibility to tell us if you do not receive your original certificate within seven business days (or any alternative timescale we suggest) from when we tell you that the certificate has been posted to you. \n\n        8.8 You must also take any additional steps reasonably needed as part of your application. \n\n        8.9 You promise that you are eligible for or entitled to the DBS certificate for which you apply. (For example, you may not be eligible for or entitled to a certificate if you live permanently outside the UK.) It is your responsibility to check before you apply. There is no refund if your application is rejected on grounds of lack of eligibility or entitlement unless (a) you have “cooling off” rights as explained above or (b) we decide in our discretion to make a refund. \n\n    9. Acceptable use of our Service\n        9.1 You agree that you will not in connection with the Service:\n            a) breach any applicable law, regulation or code of conduct;\n            b) provide us with any information that includes someone else’s personal information unless that person is 16 years or over and you have obtained that person’s explicit written consent or you are the parent/guardian of such person;\n            c) use the Service to provide a similar service to third parties or otherwise with a view to competing with us;\n            d) use the Service for junk mail, spam, pyramid or similar or fraudulent schemes;\n            e) do anything which may have the effect of disrupting the Service including  worms, viruses, software bombs or mass mailings; \n            f) do anything which may negatively affect other Users’ enjoyment of the Service;\n            g) gain unauthorised access to any part of the Service or equipment used to provide the Service; \n            h) intercept or modify communications to or from the Service;\n            i) circumvent any security or other features of the Service including features that restrict use or copying of content; or\n            j) attempt, encourage or assist any of the above.\n\n    10. Disclosure of information\n        10.1 We reserve the right without notice or refund to disclose to the police or other relevant authorities or to a complainant any information if it is the subject of complaint or where we have reason to believe that it breaches our terms and conditions, or that such steps are necessary to protect us or others, or that a criminal offence may have been committed, or where required by law or where requested by the police or other appropriate authorities.\n\n    11.
